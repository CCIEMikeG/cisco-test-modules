Repo for NXOS Ansible modules development and testing.

#### Testing modules
In order to test modules, you have to perform some tasks first:

- Clone `https://github.com/privateip/ansible.git`. This is where the new WIP Ansible version is stored.

```
ntc@ntc:~$ git clone https://github.com/privateip/ansible.git
```

- Move inside the new directory and checkout to the `network-2.2` branch.

```
ntc@ntc:~$ cd ansible
ntc@ntc:~$ git checkout network-2.2
Switched to branch 'network-2.2'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/network-2.2'.
```
